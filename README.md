Evaluation Metrics and Regression Implementation Assignment (Practical)

1. Write a Python script to visualize the distribution of errors (residuals) for a multiple linear regression model using Seaborn's "diamonds" dataset
2. Write a Python script to calculate and print Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for a linear regression model
3. Write a Python script to check if the assumptions of linear regression are met. Use a scatter plot to check linearity, residuals plot for homoscedasticity, and correlation matrix for multicollinearity.
4. Write a Python script that creates a machine learning pipeline with feature scaling and evaluates the performance of different regression models
5. Implement a simple linear regression model on a dataset and print the model's coefficients, intercept, and R-squared score.
6. Write a Python script that analyzes the relationship between total bill and tip in the tips' dataset using simple linear regression and visualizes the results.
7. Write a Python script that fits a linear regression model to a synthetic dataset with one feature. Use the model to predict new values and plot the data points along with the regression line.
8. Write a Python script that pickles a trained linear regression model and saves it to a file.
9. Write a Python script that fits a polynomial regression model (degree 2) to a dataset and plots the regression curve.
10. Generate synthetic data for simple linear regression (use random values for X and y) and fit a linear regression model to the data. Print the model's coefficient and intercept.
11. Write a Python script that fits polynomial regression models of different degrees to a synthetic dataset and compares their performance.
12. Write a Python script that fits a simple linear regression model with two features and prints the model's coefficients, intercept, and R-squared score.
13. Write a Python script that generates synthetic data, fits a linear regression model, and visualizes the regression line along with the data points.
14. Write a Python script that uses the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity in a dataset with multiple features.
15. Write a Python script that generates synthetic data for a polynomial relationship (degree 4), fits a polynomial regression model, and plots the regression curve.
16. Write a Python script that creates a machine learning pipeline with data standardization and a multiple linear regression model, and prints the R-squared score.
17. Write a Python script that performs polynomial regression (degree 3) on a synthetic dataset and plots the regression curve.
18. Write a Python script that performs multiple linear regression on a synthetic dataset with 5 features. Print the R-squared score and model coefficients.
19. Write a Python script that generates synthetic data for linear regression, fits a model, and visualizes the data points along with the regression line.
20. Create a synthetic dataset with 3 features and perform multiple linear regression. Print the model's R-squared score and coefficients.
21. Write a Python script that demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize machine learning models using joblib instead of pickling.
22. Write a Python script to perform linear regression with categorical features using one-hot encoding. Use the Seaborn 'tips' dataset.
23. Compare Ridge Regression with Linear Regression on a synthetic dataset and print the coefficients and R-squared score.
24. Write a Python script that uses cross-validation to evaluate a Linear Regression model on a synthetic dataset.
25. Write a Python script that compares polynomial regression models of different degrees and prints the R-squared score for each.
